Salish Sea NEMO Model
*********************

About the Project
=================

The Salish Sea is home to a large population of Canadians living in coastal communities at risk to ocean related hazards.
There is an ongoing need to assess the impact of these hazards on human and marine environments through a multidisciplinary approach involving Canadian oceanographers,
biologists,
and social scientists.
The Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response network
(MEOPAR_)
provides a platform to accelerate this type of research.

The Salish Sea MEOPAR project team is developing a three-dimensional ocean model for the Strait of Georgia and Salish Sea.
Using the NEMO_ modelling architecture the Salish Sea model will be used to evaluate storm surge risk in coastal communities.
Long term goals include data assimilation from the VENUS network and a coupled biogeochemical modelling component.

Evaluation
----------

**General evaluation:** as a `slide presentation`_.

.. _slide presentation: ../_static/nemo/model_evaluation_summary.pdf

**Storm surge:** The Salish Sea model's ability to calculate tides and sea surface height was evaluated by hindcasting storm surge events that occurred between 2002 and 2011.

**Mixing in San Juan/Gulf Islands:** The sensitivity of the deep water renewal into the Strait of Georgia and of fresh water pulses into Juan de Fuca Strait to modelling choices affecting both turbulence and advection has been determined.

Project Resources
=================

* The main project documentation site is at https://salishsea-meopar-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
* The project team maintains a set of Mercurial_ version control repositories for code,
  documentation (including the source files for this site),
  and analyses of model results.
  The contents of those repositories and their development history is accessible at https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/.
