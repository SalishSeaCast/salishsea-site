Salish Sea NEMO Model
*********************

About the Project
=================

The Salish Sea is home to a large population of Canadians living in coastal communities at risk to ocean related hazards.
There is an ongoing need to assess the impact of these hazards on human and marine environments through a multidisciplinary approach involving Canadian oceanographers,
biologists,
and social scientists.
The Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response network
(MEOPAR_)
provides a platform to accelerate this type of research.

The Salish Sea MEOPAR project team is developing a three-dimensional ocean model for the Strait of Georgia and Salish Sea.
Using the NEMO_ modelling architecture the Salish Sea model will be used to evaluate storm surge risk in coastal communities.
Long term goals include data assimilation from the VENUS network and a coupled biogeochemical modelling component.


Results

The most recent Storm Surge Forecast is available at http://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/storm-surge/forecast.html.
More on our storm surge modelling is available at the bottom of this page,
see :ref:`StormSurgeModeling`.
Research results on current and previous nowcasts and forecasts are available `here`_.

Project Resources
=================

* The main project documentation site is at http://salishsea-meopar-docs.readthedocs.org/.
* The project team maintains a set of Mercurial_ version control repositories for code,
  documentation (including the source files for this site),
  and analyses of model results.
  The contents of those repositories and their development history is accessible at https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/.

.. _StormSurgeModeling:

Storm Surge Modeling
====================

The Salish Sea model's ability to calculate tides and sea surface height was evaluated by hindcasting storm surge events that occurred between 2002 and 2011.
A manuscript (Soontiens et al [#]_) has been submitted.
Since Oct-2014 the model has been run daily to provide a nowcast and one or two forecasts,
providing sea surface height forecasts that are published to the web.
The Salish Sea NEMO model `forecast results`_ will form part of the `storm surge prediction and risk assessment resources`_.
