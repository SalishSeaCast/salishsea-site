Salish Sea NEMO Model
*********************

About the Project
=================

The Salish Sea is home to a large population of Canadians living in coastal communities at risk to ocean related hazards.
There is an ongoing need to assess the impact of these hazards on human and marine environments through a multidisciplinary approach involving Canadian oceanographers,
biologists,
and social scientists.
The Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response network
(MEOPAR_)
provides a platform to accelerate this type of research.

The Salish Sea MEOPAR project team is developing a three-dimensional ocean model for the Strait of Georgia and Salish Sea.
Using the NEMO_ modelling architecture the Salish Sea model will be used to evaluate storm surge risk in coastal communities.
Long term goals include data assimilation from the VENUS network and a coupled biogeochemical modelling component.

Project Resources
=================

* The main project documentation site is at http://salishsea-meopar-docs.readthedocs.org/.
* The project team maintains a set of Mercurial_ version control repositories for code,
  documentation (including the source files for this site),
  and analyses of model results.
  The contents of those repositories and their development history is accessible at https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/.

* John Morrison, Fisheries and Oceans Canada


Storm Surge Modeling
====================

Work is presently under way to evaluate the NEMO model's calculations of tides and sea surface height by hindcasting storm surge events that occurred between 2002 and 2011.
Once the model's hindcasting skill has been determined to be adequate,
and atmospheric model products of sufficient resolution are available,
the intent is to run the model to provide daily sea surface height forecasts that will be published to the web.
When that objective is reached the Salish Sea NEMO model will augment the `storm surge prediction and risk assessment resources`_ that are presently available.
